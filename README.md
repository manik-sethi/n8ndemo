I wasn't able to verify a quote from Tim Waltz. Tim Walz is an American politician serving as the junior United States Senator for Minnesota since 2018, but I couldn't find any famous or notable quotes from him. If you could provide more context, I'd be happy to try and help you find the information you're looking for.
